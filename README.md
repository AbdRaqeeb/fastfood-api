This app allows customers of a take-away restaurant to place orders and and wait for them to be prepared and delivered to a pickup counter. After placing the order the customer waits on the order to be announced before picking it up and proceeding to the dining area.

The user stories that make up this app center around four distinct roles:

- Customer - the Customer
- Order Taker - the Order Taker
- Cook - the Cook
- Server - the Server
