# fastfood-app
This app simulates customers of a take-away restaurant placing orders and and waiting for them to be prepared and delivered to a pickup counter. After placing the order the customer waits on the order to be announced before picking it up and proceeding to the dining area.

The user stories that make up this app center around four distinct roles:

- User - the end user using the application
- Customer - the simulated Customer
- Order Taker - the simulated Order Taker
- Cook - the simulated Cook
- Server - the simulated Server
